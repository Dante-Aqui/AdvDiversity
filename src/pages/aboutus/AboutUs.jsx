                                        Mentoring has long been recognized as a powerful tool in career development.
                                        Early career psychologists are advised to find mentors, either informally on
                                        their own, or to participate in formal mentoring programs. Regardless of how a
                                        mentor and mentee are matched, etiquette and ethics demand that the relationship
                                        be conducted in a professional manner with consideration and respect for both
                                        individuals. Mentoring is a dynamic process and a developmental network of
                                        mentoring can help mentees identify several mentors who can address a variety of
                                        career-related needs. Successful mentorships often evolve into friendships with
                                        both partners learning and providing support for the other.

                                        In 2006, American Psychological Association (APA) President Gerald P. Koocher,
                                        PhD, convened a presidential task force on mentoring to connect psychology
                                        graduate students and early career psychologists with more experienced senior
                                        psychologists in a range of mentoring relationships that cut across areas of
                                        scientific and professional interests. The mission of the task force was to work
                                        with organizations and individuals to facilitate mentoring relationships both
                                        formal and informal; and to leave structures in place that will sustain
                                        mentoring as an integral part of being a psychologist. To accomplish this goal,
                                        the task force created a training program for potential mentors and mentees that
                                        is appropriate for State, Provincial, and Territorial Psychological Associations
                                        and Divisions. A pilot mentoring program is being launched at the 2006
                                        convention and if it proves successful, a broader program may be established. A
                                        long term goal is to establish web-based networking for the APA membership.
                                        Further, the task force hopes these efforts will inspire diverse educational,
                                        research, and policy outcomes. To gather support for this endeavor, the task
                                        force established partnerships with the Policy and Planning Board as well as
                                        other boards and committees. They sponsored special programming at the 2006
                                        convention that stemmed from this initiative. This was produced as a general
                                        guide for prospective mentors and mentees who are interested in engaging in
                                        professional developmental relationships.
